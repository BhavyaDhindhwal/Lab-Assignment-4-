Web Dev I Lab Assignment 4 – Prompt Quizzer (A Quiz Game)
Description

This project is a simple JavaScript quiz game executed entirely in the browser console. The quiz uses an array of predefined questions and answers. It asks each question using prompt(), processes inputs (ignoring case and extra spaces), and provides feedback via alert(). At the end, it displays the user’s total score. The goal is to practice arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, and input/output in JavaScript without using HTML or DOM manipulation.

How to Use

1.	Open the browser’s developer console.
2.	 Run the quiz game script.
3.	Answer each question in the popup prompts.
4.	Receive instant feedback after each question.
5.	See your final score at the end.
